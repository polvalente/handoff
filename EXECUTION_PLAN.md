# Execution Plan for Handout Library

Below is the structured implementation plan for the Handout DAG executor library. Each task includes a checkbox to track progress.

## 1. Core Functionality

- [ ] 1.1 Define `DistributedExecutor.Function` module and struct
- [ ] 1.2 Implement dependency tracking and resolution in `Function`
- [ ] 1.3 Implement `DistributedExecutor.Supervisor` module for process lifecycle management
- [ ] 1.4 Implement `DistributedExecutor.Executor` with basic scheduling logic
- [ ] 1.5 Write initial test suite for single-node execution

## 2. Resource Management

- [ ] 2.1 Define `DistributedExecutor.ResourceTracker` behavior interface
- [ ] 2.2 Define `DistributedExecutor.Allocator` behavior interface
- [ ] 2.3 Implement static capability registration
- [ ] 2.4 Implement resource availability checking logic
- [ ] 2.5 Implement basic allocation strategies
  - [ ] 2.5.1 First-available allocation
  - [ ] 2.5.2 Load-balanced allocation
- [ ] 2.6 Extend test suite for resource-aware execution

## 3. Distribution Features

- [ ] 3.1 Implement inter-node communication and messaging
- [ ] 3.2 Implement result synchronization across BEAM nodes
- [ ] 3.3 Implement function distribution logic and task dispatch
- [ ] 3.4 Add robust error handling and recovery
  - [ ] 3.4.1 Process monitoring and failure detection
  - [ ] 3.4.2 Retry strategies for failed tasks
- [ ] 3.5 Create a distributed test suite spanning multiple nodes

## 4. Advanced Features

- [ ] 4.1 Implement runtime resource monitoring and dynamic updates
- [ ] 4.2 Implement advanced allocation strategies
  - [ ] 4.2.1 Cost-optimized allocation
  - [ ] 4.2.2 Time-optimized allocation
  - [ ] 4.2.3 Domain-specific custom strategies
- [ ] 4.3 Implement execution graph and resource usage visualization tools
- [ ] 4.4 Performance optimization and benchmarking

## 5. Integrations and Documentation

- [ ] 5.1 Write comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] 5.2 Create example applications and usage guides
- [ ] 5.3 Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and publishing
- [ ] 5.4 Prepare packaging, versioning, and release processes

## 6. Maintenance and Community

- [ ] 6.1 Add contributor guidelines and developer onboarding docs
- [ ] 6.2 Establish and publish a code of conduct
- [ ] 6.3 Create issue and pull request templates
- [ ] 6.4 Maintain project roadmap and backlog
