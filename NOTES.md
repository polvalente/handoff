- Function: add possibility of forcing a function to have the same node as another with `node: {:collocated, :another_function_id}`
- Function: some kind of annotation that a given function should always be ran instead of the value being saved. This will allow us to load certain layers of a neural network from disk regardless of where they're stored.
- Resource management in simple_allocator.ex: order nodes instead of keeping a map of nodes. If we have to move to a following node, it should be brought to the front of the list so that we prioritize allocating functions to the latest node. Just take the node and bubble it to the top.
